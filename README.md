The public folder contains all static assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files

the views folder contains the visible files in the web browser for example index.ejs.

the index.js file houses my server and the routes to my application.

package.json file contains all the dependencies

HOW IT WORKS:
Enter a random image URL, 
Enter an image size,
Click on "click me"

i targetted the html form and saved it in a variable called FormD.

i added event listener to the submit button.

using axios, i saved the url from my application backend and waited for the response data using javascript promise.

i also handled errors gracefully by using the .catch method.
